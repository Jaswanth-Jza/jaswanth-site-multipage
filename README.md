# Jaswanth’s personal website

Static multi-page website hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html` — Home
- `research.html`, `publications.html`, `outreach.html`, `music.html`, `about.html`, `contact.html`
- `assets/` — CSS/JS/media used by the pages

## Local preview

Open any HTML file directly in a browser, or run a simple local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Acknowledgements

- Some debugging/refactoring iterations were assisted by AI coding tools (ChatGPT); all changes were reviewed and tested manually.
- Slider-based “Field Controls” UI concept: credit to a Lucia Gebauer Werner(idea).
